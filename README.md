# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple web-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game where players can compete against the computer.

## Description

This project is a browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to make their selection (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on buttons, after which the computer randomly generates its choice. The result of each round is displayed immediately.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Responsive button design with hover effects
- Real-time display of player choice, computer choice, and game result
- Automatic computer selection using randomization

## File Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the game
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the game interface
- `app.js` - JavaScript logic that powers the game functionality

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click on one of the three buttons: rock, paper, or scissors
3. The computer will randomly make its choice
4. The game will display both choices and announce the winner according to these rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
   - Identical choices result in a tie

## Installation

No installation required. Simply download the files and open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
